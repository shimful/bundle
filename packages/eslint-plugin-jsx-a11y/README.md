# @shimful/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y

A bundled version of the [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y). See its license [here](#eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y).

The package [jsx-ast-utils](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/jsx-ast-utils) is also inlined to the bundle. See its license [here](#jsx-ast-utils).

Some direct and indirect dependencies of these packages have been replaced with inlined lightweight shims. The aim is to reduce the number of indirect dependencies introduced to project dependency chains.
